**General Instructions for any Brand**

All TV manufacturers differ, so menu options, wording and other items may vary. The best way to complete the channel scan is to refer to the television's owner's manual. If that is not available, try the following general instructions.  
* Locate the TV remote control.
* Go to Menu or Settings.
* Locate Channels or Set Up.
* Most digital TV sets have a scanning function typically called Auto Program, Channel Scan or some similar name. Find the scan function in the on-screen menu and start it.
* You probably will see a progress bar that shows the number of channels found. A scan can take as long as 45 minutes depending upon the TV set.
* When finished, the TV will have found all of the available channels.​
