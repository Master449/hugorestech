​HOW TO CHANNEL SCAN ON TV'S WITHOUT A REMOTE AVAILABLE  


This is especially useful for troubleshooting the New Hall Dining TV's which have a modified panel as well as the lobby rooms of residence halls.  


You will need an android phone to do this, although a similar app is probably available from the Apple store.  


  


1) Download the "Universal Remote Control" App.​  


2) Open the app and select "TV" out of the options for set top box, a/c, audio etc.

3) This will list nearby TVs that have been scanned. Select the model which matches the TV you are trying to auto scan on.

4) Find the "Menu" button.

5) Navigate to the channel scan menu(on most TVs, it'll be in the settings, setup, or channels submenu).  


  


From there it'll start the scan, and make sure to select cable when/if asked for antenna or cable. 

  


ALTERNATIVES FOR OLDER & UNDETECTED TV'S  


1) The menu buttons can sometimes be used (if accessible) to navigate to a channel scan. Play with Channel + - and Volume + - to find the proper path.

2) Power cycling a TV for a couple of minutes will sometimes run a channel scan automatically.

3) If the scan runs and only a few channels(or zero) are found, the client will probably need a cable box.
