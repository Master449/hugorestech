​​​​Initial calls from the residence halls and the Northern View Community for cable TV support will come to the Service Desk.  


\*\***There is only 1 active cable jack per room so if they want 2 TVs, they have to purchase a splitter**  
\*\*\*Neptune rooms may have two coax connections.  One old and one newer one.  The old ones don't work.  The newer style jacks are the ones that are found in the white conduit/raceway.    
​  
**Troubleshooting an individual problem:**  
  


I)      Check for correct connections, lose or damaged cables, and power on. What equipment is connected?

1. TV only
1. Power cable plugged into wall outlet and connected to TV?
2. TV on?
3. Coaxial cable connected to wall and connected to "cable in" on TV?
4. Make sure TV setting is on **Cable** and not **Antenna or Air**

3. TV with separate VCR and/or DVD
1. Power cable plugged into wall outlet and connected to TV?
2. TV power on?
3. Power cable plugged into wall and connected to VCR?
4. VCR power on?
5. Coaxial cable connected to wall and connected to "cable in" on VCR or DVD?
6. Coaxial cable connected to "out" on VCR/DVD and connected to "cable in" on TV?

5. Combination TV/VCR and/or DVD
1. Power cable plugged into wall outlet and connected to combination unit?
2. Combination unit power on?
3. Coaxial cable connected to wall and connected to "cable in" on combination unit?

If all equipment is connected and powered on, then:

II)     Programming

1. No Signal/Not receiving all channels  
  
Most TV's and VCR's today can receive either antenna or cable signals and most are programmed using the equipment's remote control.
1. Does the student have the remote control?
2. Does the student think it was properly programmed since coming to NIU?
3. If yes to both, then submit a trouble ticket to Media Services.

3. Weak signal or snow
1. Is it one channel or all channels? If all channels, then submit a trouble ticket to Media Services.

5. Not receiving all channels
1. Very old equipment may not be cable ready and old equipment may receive only 36 channels. If the equipment is cable ready, can receive more than 36 channels, and was programmed since coming to NIU, then submit a trouble ticket to Media Services.​

**Scanning for Channels: General Instructions for any TV Brand**

All TV manufacturers differ, so menu options, wording and other items may vary. The best way to complete the channel scan is to refer to the television's owner's manual. If that is not available, try the following general instructions.  
* Locate the TV remote control.
* Go to Menu or Settings.
* Locate Channels or Set Up.
* Make sure ​the input setting is set to **Cable** and not **Antenna or Air**
* Most digital TV sets have a scanning function typically called Auto Program, Channel Scan or some similar name. Find the scan function in the on-screen menu and start it.
* You probably will see a progress bar that shows the number of channels found. A scan can take as long as 45 minutes depending upon the TV set.
* When finished, the TV will have found all of the available channels.​​
**Providing Coaxial Cables**  


ResTech provides the coaxial cable for TVs provided by NIU only:  
* Cluster TVs
* Lounge TVs
* NOT personal room TVs​
**CHANNELS:** The campus CATV (Cable TV) system is an all-digital system. In order to take full advantage, students need to be sure to bring a digital TV with an integrated QAM tuner for use on campus.  A digital television with an integrated QAM tuner enables a digital TV to receive digital cable channels directly without a set top box. If in doubt, check the TV's manufacturer or owner’s manual to see if that model has a QAM tuner. ​

**​Converter Boxes**

​If a resident's tv is only picking up analog channels (2 or 3 out of the whole lineup), then they might need a converter box. Most CRT (aka tube type) TVs will not have a QAM tuner, and will need a converter box. On the other hand, most modern ​​TVs should have a QAM tuner built in. However, ​the following models typicially do include a QAM tuner and will need a box: ​Apex, Dynex, Element, Haier, Seiki or Sylvania.​  
  


* ​​If the resident chooses to, they may purchase the converter box by themselves [here.​](https://www.amazon.com/Mediasonic-Homeworx-HW180STB-Converter-Recording/dp/B00IYETYX8)

  


Installing the Mediasonic HOMEWORX HW180STB​​:* Plug in their coaxial cable to the converter box and the composite​ (or HDMI if the student has one) cable from the converter box to the TV.
* ​Change the TV input to composite​/AV/HDMI depending on the connection.
* Plug in the cable box to the power outlet​.
* Hit menu on the converter box remote while it is booting, until you get to the main menu.​

* The scan will take 15-20 minutes, so just wait until at least 10 channels appear and then you are good to go.
**​​Frequently Asked Questions and Answers:​**

**Onsite Troubleshooting with the RCA Portable LCD TV (Tier 2)**

* ​​​Coaxial cable should be connected to the cable jack run through the off-white/cream colored conduit running along the wall​
* ​​Connect the cable from the jack to the Portable TV
* Power on TV (Make sure ON switch located on the left side is enabled)
* In Menu options set TV Source to CATV (It defaults to TV)
* Then do an AUTO Scan

**How to fix a tv that is only picking up digital channels?**

* Change the antenna settings to analog
* Some tvs will scan for both digital and analog
* If the channels are digital (2.1, 5.2, etc)
**Channel scan picks up a few channels but they are not clear (static):**

* Make sure the cable is connnected to the correct jack
+ Coaxial cable should be connected to the cable jack run through the off-white/cream colored conduit running along the wall

* When onsite, connect the cable from the jack to the adapter on the laptopLaptop must be on the Windows side
+ Check channels by opening WinTV shortcut
**1 Channel has intermittent issues or out completely:**

* Check channel using cable jack in the manager's office
* Go to a tv in Stevenson Dining to check the channel

**Works on laptop but not on TV:**

* Setting on tv should be Cable, Cable-Analog, TV-Digital
* If you are certain you have tried all options on the tv, the student may need to purchase a digital converter box ($40-$50)
+ Check make/model of tv online to verify
**Doesn't work on laptop: (Tier 2)**

* Coaxial cable should be connected to the cable jack run through the off-white/cream colored conduit running along the wall
* Only 1 cable jack per room
+ If they want 2 TVs, they have to purchase a splitter

* Use our coaxial cable to connect to the adapter
+ If it still doesn't work, add the action to the ticket and request refer it
​**Channel 20 (NIU Channel - Bulletin Board):**

* Media Services removed standard definition, analog channel 20 (bulletin board).  It is replaced by digital high definition channel 20.1
+ The channel may be found in different places on different sets, and not always where 20 used to be found.
- ​Ex: The four TVs in the New Orleans room in Stevenson were scanned. On the three LG sets, they landed on 5.1. I pressed channel up and stepped through broadcast digital 5.1 to 32.x, then kept stepping through broadcast analog 2 through 13, then the next channel up was digital cable 20.1, then after that the analog cable 2 through 63. So a quick check on LG would be select ch. 2 and press channel down.

+ Kind of confusing but we are in transition to digital. A fully digital system would have all the channels in sequential order on all TVs.
- ​For now, 20.1 will be found between different channels on different models. The large Sharp in NOL put it in order, 17, 18, 20.1, 22, 23.

* In order to view this channel, **rescan** the channels on the TV.

**I live in Northern View. Can I call outside TV providers such as Comcast or DirecTV to set up service in my apartment?*** Residents of the Northern View Community are provided with the university cable TV system and are not allowed to contract with outside cable providers such as Comcast. The DoIT Service Desk provides first level cable TV support as in the residence halls.​
**Will my old analog TV still work with TV?**  
* The TV system offers only digital channels. Old style, analog televisions will not work on the TV system without a set top box.
**Can a laptop with a TV tuner ins****talled be used to watch TV?**  
* Yes, TV offers SD and HD digital stations. Any tuner that can receive an HD or SD signal will work. There is no need to decode TV digital signals as they are delivered using clear QAM.
**Do I need a converter box to receive the HD channels?*** No, you do not need a converter box to receive the HD channels if you have an HD compatible television with a clear QAM tuner.
**What is the minimum hardware requirement to view HD channels in HD and which type of set works best?*** The minimum hardware required to view HD channels is an HD compatible television. Television sets should be purchased based on the user's preferences and needs. Users are encouraged to use the same consumer product resources they would when evaluating and purchasing other electronic equipment. TV staff do not evaluate television sets nor do they provide recommendations on which sets work best.
**Will a Standard Definition (SD) television set work with all HD channels?*** No, HD programming can only be viewed on an HD compatible television set.
**Why do the digital channel numbers include a period between the numbers on the channel lineup card?**  
* Due to the technology differences between analog and digital television, multiple digital channels can fit within one channel. This is similar to radio channels, which also use decimals.
**Q.Can the HD channels be programmed using the Auto-Setup option?*** Yes, the HD channels can be programmed using the Auto-Setup option on most sets. However, this may vary depending on the manufacturer of the television set.
**How do I know if I am bringing the right television to view TV?**  
* Only Digital televisions that have SD or HD capabilities will be able to view the SD and/or HD programming on TV.
**Why won't my Westinghouse TV tune in any channels?**You need to run a channel scan:* Select auto-tune on the TV.
* Select cable. This will discover one channel and activate the tuner in the set.
* The first prompt will tell you to contact Westinghouse. This is not required to activate the tuner.
* Select next.
* The next prompt will ask you for the QAM tuner activation code. Enter 14159.
* The channel scan will start after the correct code is put in.
* After the scan is completed, you should have all of the channels.
**Why does my Sony Bravia only tune 156 channels?**  
* Your TV needs an upgrade. Go to Sony Television Support, search on the model number for your TV and follow the instructions for upgrading your TV.
**Why does my TV tune in about half of the channels, but not all of them?*** We have found that some TVs will not tune in all of the channels. This is a problem with the tuner in the TV. You will need to contact the manufacturer with the TV model number and date of purchase to get their recommendation for a solution or upgrade procedure.
**Will a DVR work with TV?**  
* If the tuner in your DVR supports signals transmitted in a QAM format, then it will be able to receive and record all of the digital and HD channels. (There is one exception with TiVo DVR. See "Will a TiVo DVR work with TV" below.)
**Will a TiVo DVR work with TV?**  
* ​Yes, it will, with one exception. The tuner in a TiVo DVR does not recognize channel numbers that have a dash or dot in the number such as 2.1, 4.1, 7.1 etc. These channels use local channel numbers and we have to carry them with this numbering format. The TiVo box will tune them in but you will not be able to record future programs on these channels.
