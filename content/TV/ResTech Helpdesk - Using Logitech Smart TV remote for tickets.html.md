The restech helpdesk has it's own Logitech 350 Harmony Universal Remote. We can now access four different TV's from that remote for troubleshooting purposes. (Primarily located in New Hall clusters and dining sections).  
  
* The two LG TV's can be selected with the "My Devices" buttons (top of the remote) labeled TV/Media and AVR/Game
* The two Sharp TV's can be selected with the "My Device" buttons labeled Cable/PC and DVD/Music​
* There is another KB about configuring the remote to add other devices for possible student support​
