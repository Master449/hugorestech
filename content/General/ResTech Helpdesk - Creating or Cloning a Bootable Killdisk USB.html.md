**​​​Creation:**

The process for creating a new Killdisk bootable USB is simple and can be done in a few steps, but first you need the correct software to do so.

Search through Sharepoint and find the "Software" Folder. In that directory there will a zip file to download and extract called "Killdisk.img and Imager." It will have two files called:  


1. Killdisk.img: the actual software to boot up killdisk and let it run.  


2.Win32DiskImager: This software images the .img file onto a USB. It is reliable and should just make a one to one clone of the .img file to the usb.  


Install Win32DiskImager, run the program, and click on the blue folder icon to search for the killdisk.img file and then select the USB device you plugged into your computer.  


Hit the "Write" option located directly in the bottom center of the program and then it will go through and transfer the image to the drive and make it a bootable freedos device that will auto run killdisk.exe.  


  


**Clone:**

The process for cloning a Killdisk USB is simpler than creating one. You will need a USB drive that had been previously imaged with Killdisk and you need a blank USB drive of equal or greater size. You will also need to download the program balenaEtcher and install it if the PC you are using does not have it already.  


The following link will take you to the download page: https://www.balena.io/etcher/​  


After installing Etcher, open it up and click on the option that says "Clone Drive" and select the drive with a Killdisk on it already. For the target, select the USB that you wish to clone the Killdisk drive over to. Hit the button to flash, wait a few minutes. and then you will have to functional copies of Killdisk.​
