**Phones**  
*SMILE!*  
-          Smiling while on the phone is a trick that tends to make your voice sound joyful.   
  
-          Smiling actually tricks the mind into thinking itself happy, so you should be in a better mood after the call.  
 

*Greeting*

-          Phones are to be answered quickly in a professional, helpful manner.

-          When you answer the phone, answer with “ResTech Help Desk, this is (name), how can I help you?”  
 

*Customer Service*

*-*Go the extra-mile to serve customers, whether by phone or in person.

-          Be Polite.

-          Customers can be angry sometimes…act professionally towards them.

-          Avoid gender specific pronouns.  It's very easy to insult someone using these terms but easily avoidable.  
 

*"Blanking" on a call*

-          If you are in the middle of a call and a question comes up that you are unaware of the answer, don't lie!  Tell them you are going to look into it and ask them to hold for a moment. Avoid saying things like "I don't know." From there simply put the user on hold and look for more information about the problem.  
  
 

*Putting a user on hold*  
-         Inform the user of what you will doing while they are on hold.  
          -           “I will be remoting into your machine and updating Java, may I put you on hold as I do this?”

-         If the process is going to take awhile offer to give them a call back when the problem has been resolved. User your judgment on how long is too long to wait, 10 minutes should probably be the maximum a user should wait.  
          -          "Windows Updates can take awhile, would you prefer if I gave you a call back when they are done?"  
 

*Transferring Calls*

Transfer calls when necessary – Don’t just give out the number.

When person is on the line:

-          Tell them you will transfer them.

-          Press 3 way call.

-          Dial the number to be transferred to.

-          Press three way call again when somebody picks up to take the caller off hold.

-          Press release.  
 

*Ending the call*

-          The problem/question has been resolved or a ticket has been created. You will want to make sure that the user has no further questions.  You should then give a sign off line.  
           -           “Do you have any more question that I may help you with?” “Have a good day!”  
 

*Phone Log Program*

![](https://intranet.restech.niu.edu/f/2139/phonelogss.png) 

You can find the phone log program on every computer in the taskbar. **Every call should be recorded here by what type of phone call it was.**  If someone calls and their problem falls under more then one of the categories, mark each of the categories.  It is important that you mark every call and walk in, this information helps us in funding the ResTech Help Desk and also other things.​
