Try updating drivers by right clicking on each name and selecting "update drivers" and then select "search online".   


       Repeat for every device that has an error  


  


If the previous step fails, then proceed to [Dells Website to grab their newest Drives and Firmware updates](https://www.dell.com/support/home/ly/en/lybsdt1/product-support/product/dell-universal-dock-d6000/drivers)

       If the link fails to show the current drivers, fill in the boxes as shown and they should eventually pop-up.

Download both driver and the firmware updates.  They will download as applications and will need to be run in order to update software.   
  


Once finished, reopen Device Manager and check to see the device is now working with the correct drivers.  Usually found in Display devices when fixed.
